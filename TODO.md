TODO;
- bang out each of the below
- then try an optimise the auto tagging...

12) need an actual reliable thing for the words on screen... and perhaps have a flag that we change in config that determines whether it shows like the whole sentence on screen, but one word at once... or just each word one by one as it does now..

===========================================


Ideas:
- extend previous
    - take the previous, put it side by side with a second image. 
    e.g. Rome was not built in a day || but in burned in six
        -> rome construction -> rome construction + fire

TODO THEN THEN:
- for when a map is shown...
    Add ability to show a map when e.g. two or more place names are mentioned:
    - place names mentioned..
    - show both places on the same map
        - but create two pictures...
            - so actually, this will be a new media type... 'addanothermappoint'... (?)
    - ==> Ideally I want to mark where is is on the map... If it's a country, show world map, if it's a county/town/city, show national map... Etc. and have a marker of the place I'm after...
    - (if it can't be done automatically, ask user to click where it should go, then add a pin and then text of what the place is called...) 
    - ........
    - well.. just make it work for like 'n' name places... 
         up to a reasonable limit like 10 places...
- Add a transtiion for things like the collage???

THEN:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manual TODO;
- Grid background (2 or 3 variations)
    ---> then two, up to five pictures layered on top, like a collage, each slightly rotated
    (Perhaps also with slight box shadow etc. to look like it's been placed there...) 
    --> I THINK THE PAPER MAY BE A BIT.. TACKY? NOT 'TIMELESS'...?


Other ideas:
- 2 to 3 brand colours? (for like labels.. text .. arrows.. stock.. etc.)
- slight rotation for layered things...
    - hmmm . yeah so either layer on prexisting background
    - would this be a variation of the 3 row???
    - i.e. better collage...
- maybe transitions etc. for when I place something in a scene manually?? 
    - (even if i place multiple items in a scene? - e.g. adding 5 coins... could have default it adds them one by one, cutting one after the other... (unless the length of the clip isn't long enough?)

    i.e. custom animations (manim?)
    - e.g. custom animated graph (e.g. bar chart or line going up.. . numbers ticking up...)
- look at powerpoint etc. for ideas on auto generation / arranging
- subjects / people should ideally be cut out and put on a background...????
    - Get picture of the person
    - pipe into remove background
    - compose that on top of the animated background

    --> would i make that a joint scene where i have the background as the first, then the second, user can choose to add 'wikipedia + decorate', where ...
        - would they need a seperate tab/window for them to remove background for second picture? or to click on subject using our extract subject, then make background white, then keyout the background??
        - then use that as the 'stamp' to stamp onto the existing background???


TODO LATER:
- maybe link up the other image providers??!?!?!?!? (or actually... just stick with pexels for now...)


For prod:
- ADD WAY FOR USERS TO EASILY GET AI TO POPULATE THE TAGS;
    - for the manual tagging;
        - add a button 'let AI populate this list for me'
        - at the top left is instructions.
        - once clicked, at the left side, it shows the json with a copy button (and which confirms when you copy)
        - at the right, there is a prompt that the user is expected to copy and paste into an AI agent chat.
        - it also has a clear button.
        - user then pastes the new json into the text box. code confirms whether its different (and perhaps other verification, like checking the keys are all the same...)

Other from better stock notes:
- motion tracking labels?
    - so the user sort of manually tracks a moving thing in a video, and we attach a label to it
- update the object edit, such that we can add text behind a selected subject?

????
- synced music
    - have a theme, switch to different footage on the beats of a song??
- speed ramps:
    - 100% -> 150% for boring middle section, snap back to 100% on beat. Great for walking, clouds, city timelapses.
- character reactions library
- Reuse a small library of stickman poses: thinking, pointing, shocked, shrug. Trigger by sentiment of line.
